RUNNING THE WEB SERVER
============================================================
Extract "testing.tar" and use it as your webserver root
directory. Run your webserver using the following command

./web_server <port> <path_to_testing>/testing <num_dispatcher> <num_workers> <dynamic_flag> <cache_flag> <queue_length> <cache_size>

**** Pick a random number other than 9000 from (1024 to 65536) to avoid collisions with other groups ****
For example, to run the web server at port 9000, with root directory "./testing" with 5 dispatch and worker threads, with dynamic and cache turned on
a queue length 50 and cache length of 50 run the following command

./web_server 9000 ./testing 5 5 1 1 50 50

You should now (using another terminal) be able to query a single file, such as the following:

wget http://127.0.0.1:9000/image/jpg/29.jpg

If you have a file containing all the URLs you want, you can open a terminal and issue the following command,

wget -i <path-to-urls>/urls -O results 

In our case we should run
wget -i /home/student/joe/testing/urls -O myres

The above command will ask wget to fetch all the URLs listed
on the file named "urls" that you downloaded from the assignment page.
